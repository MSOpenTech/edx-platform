File Storage XBlock
===================

The “File Storage XBlock” allows course staffers to add One Drive for Business (ODB) files to the courseware (courseware, course info and syllabus) by adding a link through an advanced component that they create in edX’s Studio authoring tool.

Students will view these ODB files natively on their Open edX or edX.org courses. 

Installation
------------
To install the File Storage XBlock within your edX Python environment, run the following command:

```bash
$ pip install /path/to/xblock-file-storage/
```

AZURE ACTIVE DIRECTORY SSO
==========================

Configuration options for lms.auth.json:

    "THIRD_PARTY_AUTH": {
	"AzureAD" : {
	"SOCIAL_AUTH_AZURE_PASSWORD": "",
	"SOCIAL_AUTH_AZURE_CLIENT_ID": "",
	"SOCIAL_AUTH_AZURE_DOMAIN" : ""
	}

All of these settings can be retrieved from the azure active directory app settings.

You'll need to create a new 'password', this is not done by default, you must create one after setting up the new application settings.

Client ID and Azure Domain are created by default on every new Azure setup.
